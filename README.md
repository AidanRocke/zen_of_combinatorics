# Zen of combinatorics: 
Probabilistic, Entropy, Incompressibility, Analytic and Ergodic methods in combinatorics.


## The incompressibility method and encoding arguments:

### A bit of information theory:

1. [Kraft-McMillan theorem](https://keplerlounge.com/information-theory/2021/05/13/kraft-mcmillan-theorem.html)

2. [Shannon's coding theorem for symbol codes](https://keplerlounge.com/information-theory/2021/05/13/kraft-mcmillan.html)

3. [Average-case Kolmogorov Complexity](https://keplerlounge.com/information-theory/2021/05/14/shannon-kolmogorov.html)

### Interesting applications:

1. [Almost all integers are incompressible](https://keplerlounge.com/information-theory/2021/04/26/incompressible-integers.html)

2. [Chaitin's proof of the infinitude of primes](https://keplerlounge.com/information-theory/2021/04/27/AIT-counting-primes.html)

3. [A complexity-bound on Gödel numbers](https://keplerlounge.com/formal/systems/2021/05/11/godel-numbers.html)

4. [Sets are not sequences, or the incompressibility of finite sets](https://keplerlounge.com/information/theory/2021/05/18/compressing-finite-sets.html)

### Number-theoretic applications:

1. [Compression bounds on the Copeland-Erdős constant](https://keplerlounge.com/information-theory/2021/05/11/copeland-erdos.html)

2. [An information-theoretic upper-bound on prime gaps](https://keplerlounge.com/information/theory/2021/05/19/cramer-model.html)
