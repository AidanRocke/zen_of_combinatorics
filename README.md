This collection of combinatorial methods and problems is designed to help organise math pub crawls in Leipzig, the origin of [Ars Combinatoria(1666)](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~pak/hidden/papers/Quotes/Leibniz-Arte-Combinatoria.pdf). If you'd like to share a combinatorial method, feel free to open a pull request.

2. [An information-theoretic upper-bound on prime gaps](https://keplerlounge.com/information/theory/2021/05/19/cramer-model.html)

## Fundamental constants:

Just as physical constants define the epistemic limits of our most advanced scientific theories, mathematical
constants are the fundamental building blocks of mathematics from which everything else is constructed. The
most powerful methods in discrete mathematics should ultimately illuminate the mathematical structure of
these constants.

### [Copeland-Erdős constant](https://www.renyi.hu/~p_erdos/1946-01.pdf)

This is an excellent representation of the prime numbers because no prime number exists
in isolation.

1. [Random Number Generators and Normal Numbers](https://www.davidhbailey.com/dhbpapers/bcnormal-em.pdf)

2. [Cramer's conjecture and the distribution of prime gaps](https://dms.umontreal.ca/~andrew/PDF/cramer.pdf)

3. [Goldbach's conjecture](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/GoldbachConjecture.html)

4. [Asymptotic prime partitions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.06497.pdf)

5. Classical Special functions and Lie Groups

It is worth noting that the Riemann zeta function is the generating function for the prime numbers and the most poorly
understood special function. The final theory of special functions must ultimately explain the subtle relation of the
Riemann zeta function with the other special functions such as the Gamma function.

### Archimedes' constant

### Euler's number

### Bernoulli numbers

### Euler-Mascheroni constant

### Khinchin's constant

### Chaitin's constant

### [The number of fundamental constants](https://arxiv.org/pdf/physics/0110060.pdf)

As Chaitin's constant ultimately requires the construction of super-Turing machines,
it is implicitly related to the Physical Church-Turing thesis and exploring it carefully
will probably require going beyond the Standard Model. Civilisations within the Turing
limit don't know Chaitin's constant.
